We're focusing on three important things: how safe it is, how much money people make there, and how easy it is to get to stores and services. Our study checks out these areas to help people figure out the best spot in Pittsburgh for them. We want this info to help not just people moving in but also those planning the city's future, making it a better place for everyoneã€‚"
